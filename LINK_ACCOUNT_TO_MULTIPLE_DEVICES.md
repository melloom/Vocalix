# Link Your Account to Multiple Devices

You can link your Echo Garden account to as many devices as you want using magic login links. This allows you to access the same account from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc.

## How It Works

When you generate a magic login link and scan it on another device, that device gets linked to your account. You can link unlimited devices to the same account.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Generate a Magic Login Link

1. **Open Echo Garden on your local device** (where you're currently logged in)
2. **Go to Settings** (click the gear icon or go to `/settings`)
3. **Click on the "Account" tab**
4. **Find "Log in on a new device"** section
5. **Click "Send link"** button
6. **Choose link type:**
   - **Standard (7 days)** - Good for linking devices you use regularly
   - **Extended (7 days)** - Same as standard
   - **Quick share (1 hour)** - For quick one-time linking
7. **Click "Generate link"**

### Step 2: Get the QR Code or Link

After generating the link, you'll see:
- **QR Code** - Click "Show QR" to display it
- **Link** - Copy the link if you prefer

### Step 3: Link Your Other Device

**Option A: Scan QR Code (Easiest)**
1. Open Echo Garden on your other device (phone, tablet, etc.)
2. If you're not logged in, you'll see the onboarding screen
3. **On your local device**, show the QR code
4. **On your other device**, scan the QR code with your camera
5. The app will automatically link that device to your account

**Option B: Use the Link**
1. Copy the magic login link from your local device
2. Open the link on your other device
3. The app will automatically link that device to your account

### Step 4: Verify It Worked

After scanning/linking:
- Your other device should now show your account (same handle, clips, etc.)
- You can access all your clips, listens, and settings from any linked device
- If you have admin access, it will work on all linked devices

## Important Notes

- **Unlimited Devices**: You can link as many devices as you want to the same account
- **Link Expiration**: Links expire after the time period you chose (1 hour or 7 days)
- **One-Time Use**: Each link can only be used once, but you can generate new links anytime
- **Admin Access**: If your account has admin privileges, all linked devices will have admin access
- **Same Account Everywhere**: All linked devices share the same profile, clips, and data

## Troubleshooting

### "Link has expired"
- Generate a new link and try again
- Use "Standard" or "Extended" type for longer expiration

### "Link already used"
- Each link can only be used once
- Generate a new link for additional devices

### Device not linking
- Make sure you're scanning the QR code or opening the link on the device you want to link
- Check that the link hasn't expired
- Try generating a fresh link

## Quick Access

You can also use the QR code in Settings → Account → "Access on your phone" to quickly open the app on your phone, but this doesn't link accounts - it just opens the site URL.

For account linking, use the "Log in on a new device" → "Send link" feature.
